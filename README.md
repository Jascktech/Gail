# Gail
Jason Cohn-Kleinberg

Memorial website for Gail Cohn (my grandmother who passed away recently)
The main page is essentially a timeline overview of her life.
The memories page is filled with things people remember about her from events that happened to quirks she had.
The contribute page is where people can submit any pictures or memories they had of her to potentially be added to the website at a later date.

There's a navbar at the bottom of each page with links to the other pages.

HTML and CSS were used. Bootstrap was included as well.
